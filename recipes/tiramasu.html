            In a medium saucepan, whisk together 6 egg yolks and 3/4 cup sugar
            until well blended. Whisk in 2/3 cup milk and cook over medium heat,
            stirring constantly, until the mixture boils. Boil gently for 1
            minute, remove from heat, and allow to cool slightly. Cover tightly
            and chill in the refrigerator for 1 hour.
