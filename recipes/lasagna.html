      <h3>Steps</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>
            To make the meat sauce, heat 2 tbsp olive oil in a frying pan and
            cook 750g lean beef mince in two batches for about 10 mins until
            browned all over.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Finely chop 4 slices of prosciutto from a 90g pack, then stir
            through the meat mixture.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            To make the meat sauce, heat 2 tbsp olive oil in a frying pan and
            cook 750g lean beef mince in two batches for about 10 mins until
            browned all over.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Pour over 800g passata or half our basic tomato sauce recipe and
            200ml hot beef stock. Add a little grated nutmeg, then season.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Bring up to the boil, then simmer for 30 mins until the sauce looks
            rich.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Heat the oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4 and lightly oil an ovenproof
            dish (about 30 x 20cm).
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Spoon one third of the meat sauce into the dish, then cover with
            some fresh lasagne sheets from a 300g pack. Drizzle over roughly
            130g ready-made or homemade white sauce.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Repeat until you have three layers of pasta. Cover with the
            remaining 390g white sauce, making sure you can’t see any pasta
            poking through.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Scatter 125g torn mozzarella over the top.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Arrange the rest of the prosciutto on top. Bake for 45 mins until
            the top is bubbling and lightly browned.
